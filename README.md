# N-Body Simulation
A **JavaScript-based N-body simulation** demonstrating gravitational interactions between multiple bodies using the **Velocity Verlet integration method**. Bodies move according to physics principles, making it a fun and educational tool for exploring orbital mechanics.

---

## Features

- ✅ **Accurate physics**: Every body attracts every other body via gravity  
- ✅ **Stable integration**: Uses Velocity Verlet for realistic orbits  
- ✅ **Modular design**: Easily add or remove bodies  
- ✅ **Trails**: Visualize motion paths for better understanding  
- ✅ **Expandable**: Start with 2 bodies and scale up to many
